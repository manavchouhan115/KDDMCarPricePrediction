## CS 5228 Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

#### Final Project 

#### Kaggle Team: MASS

The project involved car price prediction using classical machine learning algorithms on a Kaggle dataset. The dataset provided consisted of separate training and test sets and had a diverse set of features which could be utilized for predicting the car price. Initially, the data was processed at a high level by dropping empty feature records or feature columns and filling empty feature values using suitable encoding techniques. This was followed by a more deeper analysis where correlation of each feature was measured with the target and different feature combinations were collated to find the best set of features. Classical Machine learning algorithms like Linear regression, Lasso regression, Random forest regressors and Gradient boosting were used to train the models on top of the processed dataset with different hyper-parameters to find the optimal parameters and the best performing model.
